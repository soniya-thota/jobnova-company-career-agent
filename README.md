# Jobnova Company Career Agent

An AI-powered career discovery agent that automatically finds the official company careers page from a LinkedIn job posting.

Instead of manually searching through company websites, the agent extracts information from a LinkedIn job URL, identifies the company's recruitment platform, and locates the corresponding career page and matching job posting.

## Design Decisions

The agent uses a multi-step discovery pipeline rather than relying on a single search result.

1. Extract metadata from the LinkedIn job page.
2. Follow the Apply link.
3. Detect the recruitment platform.
4. Identify the official company website.
5. Locate the careers page.
6. Search for the corresponding job posting.
7. Return structured results with discovered links.

This layered approach improves robustness across companies using different hiring platforms.

---

## Current Limitations

- Some companies require authentication before exposing job details.
- Certain ATS providers limit automated access.
- Dynamic websites may occasionally require retries.
- Browser automation is intended for local execution.

---

## Future Improvements

- Support additional ATS providers
- Better company name normalization
- Confidence scoring for discovered results
- Parallel search pipeline
- Improved matching accuracy
- Cloud deployment support
